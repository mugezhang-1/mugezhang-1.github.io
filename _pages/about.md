I am a first-year PhD student broadly interested in multimodal large language models, reasoning, and retrieval-augmented systems. I aim to understand how models access information, reason over it, and ultimately become more reliable and useful for real-world tasks.

My current focus is on exploring ways to improve the connection between retrieval and reasoning, support multilingual and cross-modal understanding, and develop methods that help LLMs handle complex, structured inputs. More generally, I hope to contribute to building AI systems that integrate strong reasoning with practical utility for everyday users.
